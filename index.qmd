Welcome to my notes on (Non-Measure Theoretic) Probability! 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('week10/standalone_figures/semidefiniteness/semidefiniteness.svg')
```

I hope you will enjoy them, but you do have to be prepared: the notation is pretty all over the place. 

I've been honing my $\LaTeX$ tikz and pgfplots skills throughout this course, so
I hope you enjoy the diagrams I have diligently been creating throughout. 

Besides the above, here are a couple more figures I'm so thrilled to have been
able to learn how to make in $\LaTeX$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('week6/standalone_figures/conditional_expectation/conditional_expectation.svg')
knitr::include_graphics('week2/standalone_figures/measureable_f/measureable_f.svg')
knitr::include_graphics('week4/standalone_figures/converging_normals/converging_normals.svg')
```
